- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name's Raphael. Welcome to my Github!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphael-wang-62a278aa) is a good place, but I'm also quite responsive to emails.

There isn't much here, but I'm hoping to add more projects in the future
